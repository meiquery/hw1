# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Here I have refactored a webpage for Horiseon Managemnet Company.  Consolidating elements of the code, adding comments, ensuring full functionality, as well as meeting basic accessibility as to be most available in search engines & for other dev's further work on the project.
